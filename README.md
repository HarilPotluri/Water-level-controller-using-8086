# Water-level-controller-using-8086
  Water is a precious resource and its conservation is important for
sustainable development. Water storage tanks are commonly used in
domestic households to store water for daily use. The water level in
these tanks needs to be monitored and controlled to prevent overflow
and to ensure that there is always enough water in the tank. This can be
done manually, but it is inconvenient and time-consuming. Therefore,
an automatic water level controller is needed.

   To ensure the availability of water while avoiding wastage, it is
necessary to monitor and control the water level in these tanks.
Traditionally, this has been done manually by periodically checking the
tank and adjusting the water flow accordingly. However, this method
is not only inconvenient but also prone to human error, leading to
potential overflows or water shortages.
   To address these challenges, an automatic water level controller
is a practical solution. This device uses various technologies and
sensors to accurately measure the water level in the tank and regulate
the inflow and outflow of water accordingly. By automating the
process, it eliminates the need for constant manual monitoring, saving
time and effort for users.
    The automatic water level controller operates based on preset
parameters, such as desired maximum and minimum water levels.
When the water level reaches the upper threshold, the controller
activates a mechanism to stop the inflow of water, preventing overflow.
Similarly, when the water level drops below the lower threshold, the
controller triggers the inflow to maintain an adequate supply.
